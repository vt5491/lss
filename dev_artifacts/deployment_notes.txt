1) check out on EC2 to $LSS
2) You can only do a "dev" build and not a full production build because the code is not fully aot compatible (I have things like js deconstruction that aren't allows in aot builds)

# this builds, but do any optimization.  You also need to specify the "--base-href"
#ng build

# this is better
ng build --base-href='/apps/lss/' --deploy-url='/apps/lss' --configuration=dev

Note: if using configuration=dev you shouldn't need to specify '--configuration'
because I specified:

              "deployUrl" : "/apps/lss/",
              "baseHref" : "/apps/lss/"

in angular.json

# note closing and ending "/" are important

bottom line:
use:
ng build

if doing a debug type of thing (code won't be minified)

use:
ng build configuration=dev

for a standard optimized (but non-aot) build.

3) Copy from dist to $LSS_DEPLOY dir:
a) cd $LSS_DEPLOY
b) sudo rm -rf *
c) sudo cp -R $LSS/dist/* .

( or sudo cp -R /home/ubuntu/resources/github/lss/dist/* .)
